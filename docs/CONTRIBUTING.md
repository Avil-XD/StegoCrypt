## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Follow naming conventions:
  ```javascript
  // Variables and functions in camelCase
  const myVariable = value;
  function doSomething() {}

  // Classes in PascalCase
  class MyClass {}

  // Constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  const MAX_SIZE = 1000;
  ```
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions
   - Mock dependencies
   - Cover edge cases

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
   - Test file processing
   - Test encryption/decryption

3. **Browser Testing**
   - Test in latest versions of:
     - Chrome
     - Firefox
     - Safari
     - Edge

### Security Considerations

1. **Data Handling**
   - Never transmit sensitive data
   - Clear sensitive data from memory
   - Use secure random number generation

2. **Encryption**
   - Use standard encryption libraries
   - Implement proper key management
   - Follow security best practices

3. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize file inputs
   - Check file sizes and types

### Performance

1. **Image Processing**
   - Optimize large image handling
   - Use WebWorkers for heavy tasks
   - Implement progress indicators

2. **Memory Management**
   - Clean up unused resources
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Handle large files efficiently
