## üöÄ Try It Now

Visit [StegoCrypt Live Demo](https://avil-xd.github.io/StegoCrypt) to try it instantly in your browser.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Select an Image** - Upload or drag & drop any PNG/JPEG
2. **Enter Message** - Type your secret message
3. **Optional Encryption** - Add a password for extra security
4. **Download** - Get your image with hidden message

The tool uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography to hide your message in the image's pixel data. When encryption is enabled, messages are secured with AES-256 before embedding.
